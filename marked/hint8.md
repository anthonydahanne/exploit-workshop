# Hint 8

By replacing the ; of ```&#58;``` with a command, like ```this;``` or ```document;``` the sanitization does not recognise &#58 as a colon as it does not have the trailing ; 

However, modern browsers recognise &#58 as almost a colon, so ‘help’ out by showing it as a colon. This provides us with the exploit we need to create a link that can execute JavaScript when clicked. If you haven't run the command below, go ahead and try it:

```
[Bad Link](javascript&#58this;alert(1&#41;)
```

This should work and when you click your Bad Link todo entry you should see your alert.
